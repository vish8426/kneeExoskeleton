Knee Exoskeleton Design

## About
 The following project highlights the design of a Hinged Knee Brace Exoskeleton aimed
 toward the demographic of children suffering from Cerebral Palsy. The design encompasses
 a range of specifications to allow for assistance to the child with the motions of sitting,
 standing and walking and transition between them. Therefore, the overall design will assist
 and address the issue of motion being prohibited and limited with children that suffer from
 the condition.

## Overview

Cerebral Palsy often impairs motor function, limiting a child's ability to perform essential movements. This project focuses on designing a mechanical exoskeleton that provides assistive support to the knee joint, facilitating improved mobility for children with CP.

## Project Objectives

- Develop a mechanical design that supports knee joint movements essential for sitting, standing, and walking.
- Ensure the exoskeleton is lightweight, adjustable, and comfortable for pediatric use.
- Incorporate safety features to prevent hyperextension and accommodate varying degrees of mobility impairment.
- Validate the design through simulations and, if possible, prototype testing.

## Design Features

- **Hinged Knee Mechanism**: Allows natural flexion and extension of the knee joint.
- **Adjustable Straps**: Accommodate different leg sizes and provide secure fitting.
- **Lightweight Materials**: Utilize materials that reduce the overall weight without compromising strength.
- **Safety Stops**: Prevent excessive movement that could lead to injury.
- **Modular Components**: Facilitate easy maintenance and potential upgrades.

## System Architecture

The exoskeleton comprises the following components:

- **Frame Structure**: Provides the main support and houses the hinge mechanism.
- **Joint Assembly**: Mimics the natural movement of the knee, allowing controlled motion.
- **Strapping System**: Ensures the exoskeleton remains securely attached during movement.
- **Padding**: Enhances comfort and reduces pressure points.

## Methodology

1. **Needs Assessment**: Analyze the specific mobility challenges faced by children with CP.
2. **Conceptual Design**: Develop initial sketches and 3D models of the exoskeleton.
3. **Material Selection**: Choose materials that balance strength, weight, and comfort.
4. **Simulation**: Use CAD software to simulate stress, strain, and movement.
5. **Prototype Development**: If feasible, create a physical prototype for testing.
6. **Evaluation**: Assess the design's effectiveness in assisting movement and its comfort during use.

## Results

- **Design Validation**: Simulations indicate the exoskeleton can support the necessary movements without exceeding material stress limits.
- **User Comfort**: The adjustable and padded design aims to maximize comfort for pediatric users.
- **Mobility Enhancement**: The exoskeleton is expected to aid in performing daily activities, thereby improving the quality of life for children with CP.

## Applications

- **Rehabilitation Centers**: Assist in physical therapy sessions to improve motor functions.
- **Home Use**: Provide daily support for mobility within the home environment.
- **Educational Institutions**: Enable better participation in school activities by enhancing mobility.
