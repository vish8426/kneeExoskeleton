Knee Exoskeleton Design

## About
 The following project highlights the design of a Hinged Knee Brace Exoskeleton aimed
 toward the demographic of children suffering from Cerebral Palsy. The design encompasses
 a range of specifications to allow for assistance to the child with the motions of sitting,
 standing and walking and transition between them. Therefore, the overall design will assist
 and address the issue of motion being prohibited and limited with children that suffer from
 the condition.
